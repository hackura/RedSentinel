# RedSentinel 🟥

AI‑Assisted Red / Purple Team Simulation & Analysis Framework

> **Educational & research use only** — RedSentinel supports both **offline analysis** and **controlled live testing**, depending on the selected mode.

---

## 🔍 What RedSentinel Is

RedSentinel is a **modular security analysis and attack‑path simulation tool** designed to help:

* Security students
* SOC analysts
* Blue / Purple teams

understand how vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and logs can be **correlated into realistic attack paths**.

It supports **multiple operational modes**, each doing a *different thing*, via an interactive menu or direct CLI usage.

---

## ⚙️ Core Capabilities

### 1️⃣ Log & Scan Analysis (Offline)

* Parses existing scan outputs (e.g. Nikto)
* Analyzes logs and findings
* Assigns CVSS‑style risk scoring
* Builds attack paths **without executing exploits**

### 2️⃣ Attack Plan Generation (Simulation)

* Generates **theoretical exploit chains**
* Maps attacker steps, prerequisites, and impact
* No payloads executed
* Safe for academic and defensive environments

### 3️⃣ Live Testing (Controlled)

* Optional **live analysis mode**
* Target‑based testing when explicitly selected
* Intended for labs, owned systems, or permission‑based targets only

⚠️ **Nothing runs live unless the user explicitly chooses it**

### 4️⃣ Exploit‑Driven Reporting

* Exploit logic is used to:

  * Explain feasibility
  * Demonstrate impact
* **Only this mode generates PDF reports**

### 5️⃣ Reporting Engine

* HTML reports (default)
* PDF reports (exploit mode only)
* Risk heatmaps & summaries

---

## Interactive Menu

RedSentinel includes an interactive menu that lets you choose exactly what you want to do:

* Log / scan analysis
* Attack plan simulation
* Live testing (explicit)
* Exploit analysis + PDF reporting

Each menu option triggers a **different execution path** internally.

---

##  Example CLI Usage

```bash
python3 -m redsentinel.cli menu
```

Depending on the selected mode, this may:

* Analyze existing scan/log inputs
* Simulate an attack plan
* Perform controlled live checks

## 🧪 Testing

Pytest is used to validate:

* Analyzer logic
* Planner correctness
* Risk scoring consistency

```bash
pytest
```

---

##  Installation (Editable / Dev)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hackura/RedSentinel.git
cd RedSentinel
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

---

##  Disclaimer

RedSentinel is intended for:

* Education
* Research
* Authorized testing only

You are responsible for ensuring you have **explicit permission** before performing any live testing.

---

## 🧠 Roadmap

* BlueSentinel (defensive correlation)
* SIEM‑style log ingestion
* MITRE ATT&CK mapping
* Web UI
* Plugin‑based scanners
